  which are all necessary to run bump_demo.m
  
  To get an idea of what can be done with these functions, in MATLAB issue:
  bump_demo

  This should create some figures.
  
  Read bump_demo.m's comments for parameters you can play with in this demo or
  to walk through how to use these functiosn to set up a mixed fem variational
  surface modelling application.

  = Dependencies =
  There are no dependecies to run the code as is (besides MATLAB, of course)

  To generate irregular meshes you will need to install Triangle by Jonathan
  Richard Shewchuk and tell execute_triangle.m where to find the triangle
  program on your computer (this part might be posix specific, so if you're on
  windows you're on your own).
  Triangle was found at:
