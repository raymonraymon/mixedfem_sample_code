%   - Generate a 3D planar triangle mesh, regular or irregular grid
%   - Determine interior and rows into exterior 
%   - Build and factor matrices for biharmonic and triharmonic systems with various
%     options
%   - Solve systems for new positions of mesh, given boundary conditions of

%               random
mesh_type = 'regular';
% Defines mass matrix type:
%   'barycentric' uses barycentric area
%   'voronoi' uses hybrid of voronoi area (for acute triangles) and constant 
%             area (for obtuse triangles)
masstype = 'voronoi';
% Determines boundary type for biharmonic system
%   'ext' region conditions (need to fix two rows into exterior)

bi_bndtype = 'deriv';
% Determines boundary type for triharmonic system
%   'extx' region conditions (need to fix three rows into exterior)
%   'extxy' extension curve conditions (need to fix two rows and specify bezier
%           curves at second row), experimental
%   'extxy-single' extension curve conditions (need to fix one row and specify 
%                  bezier curves), not implemented here
tri_bndtype = 'extx';
% Reduce system to only solve for u (eliminate auxillary variables by inverting
% the diagonal mass matrix) 
%   'flatten' reduce system, only valid for region conditions 
%             [Botsch and Kobbelt, 2004]
%   'no_flatten' do NOT reduce system, valid for all boundary conditions
